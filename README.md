# tuchoven
A little indicator for computer science class management. It has an RGB LED and two pushbuttons, when you press button start, led lights, indicating that the student needs the teacher (tucho) to come (ven) and help him/her. Every while (minute could be fine?), if the teacher has not attended the student demand, ligh will change color according to the sequence purple - cyan - blue - yellow - red, so that the teacher knows who has been waiting the most. When the light gets red, it stays there. When teacher solves the student's problem, presses reset button to turn light off. If the student has finished his work and wants to let the teacher know, can long press the start button and a green light will start to fade out and in.
